#I made this repo to share my modifications to the official Prusa Firmware
## Please checkout the appropriate branch for your printer

Firmware for other printers, based on prusaMK2 with automatic mesh bed leveling

What is this repo ?

I own a prusa MK2 and I think the FW is superb. I wanted to port it to my other machines. At the same time I'd like to share it with you. If it suits your need, just clone it :)

Enjoy
